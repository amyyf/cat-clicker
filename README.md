# Cat Clicker

This is a project for a [JavaScript Design Patterns course](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989) I completed as part of my Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. I learned how to use MV* design patterns in vanilla JavaScript to organize and reorganize code. The project requirements changed over the course of the class to mimic how a live project's requirements will constantly change over its lifecycle. Lots of refactoring!

Here were the requirements through the different stages of the project, in chronological order, which is the reverse of my commit history, obviously:

1. Make a webpage with a picture of a cat. Count how many times the cat is clicked.
1. Add a second cat. Keep track of clicks for each cat.
1. Add five cats, track all of their clicks, and only display their picture when their name is chosen from a list.
1. Refactor to use an MV* design pattern. Udacity calls theirs MVO, where O stands for . . . octopus. Because it connects the model and view but holds them at arms' length. :octopus:
1. **Cat Clicker Premium Pro** Add an Admin Panel, hidden by default, where the cat data can be changed by the user.

I am proud of the fact that I chose to create a Cat class on my first refactor, so when I was then instructed to instantiate five cats, my app was already scalable.
